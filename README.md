This repository contains a simple C++ program that demonstrates a common runtime error: division by zero. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version that handles potential division by zero exceptions.  The error is likely to cause a program crash or unexpected results.  The solution demonstrates safe division practices.
